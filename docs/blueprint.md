## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6495ED) to convey professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Very light blue/gray (#F0F8FF).  Visibly of the same hue as the primary color, but heavily desaturated and brightened for a clean, uncluttered backdrop that won't distract the eye.
- Accent color: A soft green (#8FBC8F), approximately 30 degrees 'left' of blue, for a touch of approachability.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Literata' (serif) for headlines. 'Inter' provides a modern, neutral feel for easy reading, while 'Literata' adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to the headlines.
- Clean and structured layout: Utilize a grid system to organize content effectively.  Ensure consistent spacing and alignment for a professional appearance.
- Minimalist icons: Use simple, line-based icons to represent different sections and skills, ensuring they complement the overall aesthetic.
